**Serverless Application with AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Terraform, and GitHub Actions**

**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates a serverless CRUD application deployed on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform. The application leverages AWS Lambda for compute, DynamoDB for persistence, and API Gateway to expose RESTful endpoints. Deployment is automated with GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

**Tech Stack**

- AWS Lambda 
- AWS DynamoDB 
- AWS API Gateway
- AWS IAM roles/policies
- Terraform 
- GitHub Actions 
- Postman

**Best Practices**

- Use environment variables for configs
- Keep secrets in GitHub Actions Secrets.
- Destroy unused resources to avoid costs.

**Outcome**

A fully automated serverless application that demonstrates the use of IaC, CI/CD, and AWS serverless services. The project serves as an example of designing, deploying, and managing a scalable backend without managing servers.
